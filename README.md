# Amarna

Amarna is a static-analyzer and linter for the Cairo programming language.

## Features
 - Finds code-smells and potential vulnerabilities in Cairo code
 - Compiler-identical parsing of Cairo code and StarkNet contracts
 - Supports creating local and global rules
 - Exports the parsed AST of a Cairo file
 - Exports static-analysis results to the [SARIF](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/) format.

## Basic Usage
Analyze a Cairo project in the current directory and export the SARIF results to a file:
 ```bash
 amarna . -o out.sarif
 ```

Analyze a single file `file.cairo` and export the SARIF results to a file:
 ```bash
 amarna file.cairo -o out.sarif
 ```

Analyze a single file `file.cairo` and print a summary of the results:
 ```bash
 amarna file.cairo -s
 ```

### Integration
 - For GitHub action integration, use [amarna-action](https://github.com/crytic/amarna-action).

## Usage
Analyze a Cairo project in the current directory and export results to a file:
 ```bash
 amarna . -o out.sarif
 ```

Analyze a single file `deleverage.cairo` and export results to a file:
 ```bash
 amarna deleverage.cairo -o deleverage.sarif
 ```

Analyze a single file `code.cairo` and print a summary of the results:
 ```bash
 amarna code.cairo -s
 ```

Parse a Cairo file and output the recovered AST in `png`:
 ```bash
 amarna file.cairo -png
 ```

Analyze a Cairo file with the unused_import rule:
 ```bash
 amarna file.cairo --rules=unused-imports
 ```

Analyze a Cairo file using all rules except the arithmetic-add rule:
 ```bash
 amarna file.cairo --except-rules=arithmetic-add
 ```

                        Only run this set of rules. Enter rule names comma-separated, e.g., dead-store,unused-arguments
  -exclude-rules EXCLUDE_RULES, --exclude-rules EXCLUDE_RULES
                        Exclude these rules from the analysis. Enter rule names comma-separated, e.g., dead-store,unused-arguments

```

## SARIF file format
The [SARIF](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/) file format is a standard format for static-analysis tools and can be viewed in vscode with the [official extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/sarif-vscode-extension/).


## Installation
```bash
pip install amarna
```


## How the rules work
The static-analysis rules can be:
   - local rules, which analyse each file independently.
   - gatherer rules, which analyse each file independently and gather data to be used in post-process rules.
   - post-process rules, which run after all files were analyzed can use the data gathered in the gatherer rules.

Examples of these are:
 - local rules: find all arithmetic operations in a file
 - gatherer rules: gather all declared functions, and called functions
 - post-process rules: find unused functions using the gathered data, i.e., functions that were declared but never called.


## Rule allowlist, denylist and inline comments

### Rule names
Obtain the names of the currently implemented rules with:
```bash
 amarna --show-rules
```

### Rule allowlist
Run amarna with a defined set of rules using
```bash
 amarna --rules=rule1,rule2 .
```

The following command will only run the `unused-imports` rule and print the summary result
```bash
 amarna --rules=unused-imports . -s
```

### Rule denylist
Run amarna with all rules except a defined set of rules using
```bash
 amarna --exclude-rules=arithmetic-add,arithmetic-sub . -s
```

### Inline rule disabling comments
You can change the first line of a cairo file to disable a specific rule set on that file.
For example, adding the line
```c
// amarna: disable=arithmetic-div,arithmetic-sub,arithmetic-mul,arithmetic-add
```
as the first line of `file.cairo` and running amarna with
```bash
amarna directory/ --disable-inline -s
```
will not report any arithmetic rule to the `file.cairo` file.
