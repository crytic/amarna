# Amarna

Amarna is a static-analyzer and linter for the Cairo programming language.

## Features
 - Finds code-smells and potential vulnerabilities in Cairo code
 - Compiler-identical parsing of Cairo code and StarkNet contracts
 - Supports creating local and global rules
 - Exports the parsed AST of a Cairo file
 - Exports static-analysis results to the [SARIF](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/) format.


### Currently supported rules

| #   | Rule                        | What it finds                                                                                                             | Impact  | Precision |

| 7   | Inconsistent assert usage   | Asserts that use the same constant in different ways, e.g., `assert_le(amount, BOUND)` and `assert_le(amount, BOUND - 1)` | Warning | High      |
| 8   | Dead stores                 | Variables that are assigned values but not used before a return statement                                                 | Info    | Medium    |

| 10  | Caller address return value | Function calls to the `get_caller_address` function.                                                                      | Info    | High      |



## Usage
Analyze a Cairo project in the current directory and export results to a file:
 ```bash
 amarna . -o out.sarif
 ```

Analyze a single file `deleverage.cairo` and export results to a file:
 ```bash
 amarna deleverage.cairo -o deleverage.sarif
 ```

Analyze a single file `code.cairo` and print a summary of the results:
 amarna code.cairo -s

Parse a Cairo file and output the recovered AST in `png`:
 ```bash
 amarna file.cairo -png
 ```

Analyze a Cairo file with the unused_import rule:
 ```bash
 amarna file.cairo --rules=unused-imports
 ```

Analyze a Cairo file using all rules except the arithmetic-add rule:
 ```bash
 amarna file.cairo --except-rules=arithmetic-add
 ```

The full help menu is:
```
usage: amarna [-h] [-p] [-o OUTPUT] [-summary] [-png] -f

Amarna is a static-analyzer for the Cairo programming language.

positional arguments:
  -f                    the name of the .cairo file or directory with .cairo files to analyze

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p, --print           print output
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        file to write the output results in sarif format
  -summary, --summary   output summary
  -png, --png           save a png with the AST of a file
```

## SARIF file format
The [SARIF](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/) file format is a standard format for static-analysis tools and can be viewed in vscode with the [official extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/sarif-vscode-extension/).


## Installation
```bash
git clone git@github.com:trailofbits/amarna.git && cd amarna
pip install -e .
```


## How the rules work
The static-analysis rules can be:
   - local rules, which analyse each file independently.
   - gatherer rules, which analyse each file independently and gather data to be used in post-process rules.
   - post-process rules, which run after all files were analyzed can use the data gathered in the gatherer rules.

Examples of these are:
 - local rules: find all arithmetic operations in a file
 - gatherer rules: gather all declared functions, and called functions
 - post-process rules: find unused functions using the gathered data, i.e., functions that were declared but never called.

# Roadmap: Cairo patterns to implement in the future
 - [ ] find uninitialized variables
 - [ ] using ap and fp registers manually
 - [ ] call and jmp and revoked references
 - [ ] undefined behavior when using [ap] directly
 - [ ] callback before tempvars -- the callback might overwrite local variable memory.
